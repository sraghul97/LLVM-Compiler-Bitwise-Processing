# LLVM-Compiler-Bitwise-Processing

Bitwise Processing Language (P1) Compiler

This repository contains the implementation of Project 1 for ECE 466/566, which focuses on developing a compiler for the bitwise processing language (P1). The project involves using Flex & Bison for parsing the P1 language and generating LLVM bitcode for subsequent compilation. The P1 language supports various bitwise operations and constructs, and the goal is to provide a robust compiler that translates P1 code into LLVM IR efficiently. The repository includes code for the lexer and parser, as well as the LLVM code generation logic. Documentation and examples are provided to help users understand the compiler's functionality and the P1 language syntax.

Key Features:
Lexer and parser implemented using Flex & Bison
LLVM IR code generation for bitwise operations
Sample P1 programs and test cases
Comprehensive documentation on usage and design
